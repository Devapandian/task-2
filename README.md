write a blog on the different between document & window objects

The document object represents the web page's content and is the parent of all HTML elements on the page. It's responsible for providing a structure to the web page and enabling the manipulation of its content. The document object is created automatically when a web page is loaded and can be accessed through the global window object.

The window object represents the browser window that displays the web page. It's responsible for controlling the browser's behavior and provides access to many of the browser's features, such as the navigation history, location, and browser settings. The window object is the global object in the browser environment and can be accessed by any script running on the web page.
